# Invisible-Cloak
Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisibility cloak. Well it turns out that using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfil my childhood fantasy. We will create this magical experience using an image processing technique called Color detection and segmentation.
Why Red?
Sure, we could have used green or any other color also.
